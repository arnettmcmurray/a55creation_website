Locked in. Here are the design directions I’ll keep on standby for when you bring me the photos:

🎨 Visual Vibe

Warm neutrals & earth tones → beige, cream, soft gray, muted greens, deep browns.

Accent pops from fabric → quilt reds, yarn blues, patterned stitches.

Texture-forward → mimic fabric feel with subtle background patterns (linen, weave, stitch-like borders).

✍️ Typography

Headings → serif font (handcrafted, classic feel).

Body text → clean sans-serif (easy to read, modern balance).

Optional script font for her name/logo if you want a signature vibe.

🖼 Gallery

Grid stays clean, but:

Add “Sold Out” tags styled like fabric labels.

Use hover effects (slight zoom/pan like Andrew Scott’s).

Maybe a quilted border frame for photos.

🧵 Persona Elements

Swap plain white for a light canvas/linen texture background.

Footer could carry a needle & thread line or knitting icon motif.

Navigation subtle hover color → thread gold or quilt red.

So when you show up with photos, we can spin the CSS from minimal art gallery → cozy handmade boutique without touching the structure.
